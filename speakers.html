                        <h5>LEVELING UP WITH FLEXBOX</h5>
                        <p>By now, you’ve probably heard of “flexbox,” short for the CSS Flexible Box Layout module and the most fully developed and well supported of CSS3’s wide array of new layout mechanisms. Flexbox allows you to create fluid, responsive layouts without having to worry about all those pesky float layout quirks we’ve dealt with for over a decade. But with cross-browser support still incomplete, you’ve probably relegated flexbox to the “one day” pile of web design tricks.<br> <br>It’s time to stop waiting. In this talk, Zoe aims to convince you that it’s a good idea to start learning and using flexbox today. You’ll learn how to take your designs—and web design skills—to the next level as we use flexbox as practical progressive enhancement, adding it in bits and pieces on individual page components with graceful fallbacks.</p>
                        <h5>ABOUT ZOE</h5>

Zoe currently works as a UX designer for Booking.com.</p>
